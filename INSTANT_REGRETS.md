# I'm going to regret my life choices

I took the oportunity of this challenge to learn Lua in which I'm a complete beginner.
I might use this file to yell at myself during the process.

Alright, I knew that chosing a language where arrays start at 1 for an address manipulation program was a poor choice.

How to test the main module in Lua since `require` will also execute it :-(
